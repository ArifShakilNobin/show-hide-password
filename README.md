# ShowHidePassword

This is the repository for my article on creating a show or hide password feature up on dev.to.
The article explains how we use ngClass, angular forms, bootstrap 4 and fontawesome icons to create such a helpful feature, enjoy the post! I hope you find it useful someday.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
